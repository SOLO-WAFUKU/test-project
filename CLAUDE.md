# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a simple JavaScript project containing a single file (`index.js`) that demonstrates basic programming concepts. The current implementation calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 10.

## Commands

- **Run the program**: `node index.js`
- **View file contents**: `cat index.js`

## Architecture

This is a minimal JavaScript project with no dependencies or build system. The entire codebase consists of:

- `index.js`: Main executable file containing the core logic

The project follows a simple procedural programming approach with no external dependencies or frameworks.
